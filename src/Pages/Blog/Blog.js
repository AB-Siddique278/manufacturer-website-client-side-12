                   <br/>
                    Data immutability is not an architecture or design pattern, itâ€™s an opinionated way of writing code. This forces you to think about how you structure your application data flow. In my opinion, data immutability is a practice that revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow.

                    In React, function components and PureComponent provide two different ways of optimizing React apps at the component level. Function components prevent constructing class instances while reducing the overall bundle size as it minifies better than classes.

                    <br />
                    
                    If you are using webpack 4 as a module bundler for your app, you can consider setting the mode option to production. This basically tells webpack to use the built-in optimization
